# Icons Placeholder

This directory should contain the following icon files:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon32.png (32x32 pixels) 
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

These should be PNG images representing your extension. You can create them using any image editor.

For now, you can use simple colored squares or download icons from:
- https://icons8.com
- https://www.flaticon.com
- Create simple icons using tools like Canva or Figma

The icons should represent the "add to todo" or "Notion" functionality.
